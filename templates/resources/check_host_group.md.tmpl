# endpointmonitor_check_host_group (Resource)

Create and manage groups of Check Hosts that can assigned to checks to execute on.

-> **Information:** When creating a Check Host Group, then EndPoint Monitor API will silently drop any Check Host Ids given to it that are not valid in order for the request to still succeed with the other id's given. This may result in Terraform always proposing modification to the `check_host_ids` on each plan.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "endpointmonitor_check_hosts" "agents" {
  search = "agents"
}

resource "endpointmonitor_check_host_group" "example" {
  name             = "ECS Agent Cluster"
  description      = "ECS agent cluster for website checks"
  enabled          = true
  check_host_ids   = endpointmonitor_check_hosts.agents.ids
}
```
