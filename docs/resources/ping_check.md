# endpointmonitor_ping_check (Resource)

Create and manage ping checks to check a hostname or address is online.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example Ping Check that uses the endpointmonitor_check_host and
# endpointmonitor_check_group data sources to get the id of the 
# group it sits in and the host it is to run on.

data "endpointmonitor_check_host" "controller" {
  search = "controller"
}

data "endpointmonitor_check_group" "network" {
  search = "Network Checks"
}

resource "endpointmonitor_ping_check" "example" {
  name            = "Ping Access Point 1"
  hostname        = "ap01.internal.mycompany.com"
  check_frequency = 30
  trigger_count   = 3
  check_host_id   = data.endpointmonitor_check_host.controller.id
  check_group_id  = data.endpointmonitor_check_group.network.id

  warning_response_time = 2000
  timeout_time          = 5000
}
```

- `timeout_time` (Number) The number of milliseconds to wait for a response before giving up.
- `trigger_count` (Number) The sequential number of failures that need to occur for a check to trigger an alert or notification.
- `warning_response_time` (Number) The warning response time threshold in milliseconds.

### Optional

- `check_host_group_id` (Number) The id of the Check Host Group to run the check on.
- `check_host_id` (Number) The id of the Check Host to run the check on.
- `description` (String) A space to provide a longer description of the check if needed. Will default to the name if not set.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Allows the enabling/disabling of the check from executing.
