# endpointmonitor_socket_check (Resource)

Create and manage socket checks which test to ensure a hostname is listening on a pre-defined port.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example Socket Check that uses the endpointmonitor_check_host and
# endpointmonitor_check_group data sources to get the id of the 
# group it sits in and the host it is to run on.

data "endpointmonitor_check_host" "controller" {
  search = "controller"
}

data "endpointmonitor_check_group" "database" {
  search = "Database Checks"
}

resource "endpointmonitor_socket_check" "example" {
  name            = "Primary Database Listening"
  hostname        = "db01.internal.mycompany.com"
  check_frequency = 30
  port            = 5432
  trigger_count   = 2
  check_host_id   = data.endpointmonitor_check_host.controller.id
  check_group_id  = data.endpointmonitor_check_group.database.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `check_frequency` (Number) The frequency the check will be run in seconds.
- `check_group_id` (Number) The id of the Check Group the check belongs to. This also determines check frequency.
- `hostname` (String) The hostname to check.
- `name` (String) A name to describe in the check, used throughout EndPoint Monitor to describe this check, including in notifications.
- `port` (Number) The TCP port to check is listening.
- `trigger_count` (Number) The sequential number of failures that need to occur for a check to trigger an alert or notification.

### Optional

- `check_host_group_id` (Number) The id of the Check Host Group to run the check on.
- `check_host_id` (Number) The id of the Check Host to run the check on.
- `description` (String) A space to provide a longer description of the check if needed. Will default to the name if not set.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Allows the enabling/disabling of the check from executing.
- `maintenance_override` (Boolean) If set true then notifications and alerts will be suppressed for the check.
- `proxy_host_id` (Number) The id of the Proxy Host the check should use for a HTTP proxy if needed.
- `result_retention` (Number) The number of days to store historic results of the check.

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Socket checks can be imported using their numeric id, which can be see in the address bar when editing a check in the web interface.
terraform import endpointmonitor_socket_check.example 123
```
