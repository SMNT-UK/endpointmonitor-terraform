# endpointmonitor_dns_check (Resource)

Create and manage DNS checks which check that a hostname revolves to a known set of addresses.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example DNS Check that uses the endpointmonitor_check_host and
# endpointmonitor_check_group data sources to get the id of the 
# group it sits in and the host it is to run on.

data "endpointmonitor_check_host" "controller" {
  search = "controller"
}

data "endpointmonitor_check_group" "dns" {
  search = "DNS Checks"
}

resource "endpointmonitor_dns_check" "example" {
  name               = "Loadbalancer Failure Check"
  description        = "Checks the load balancer hasn't automatically failed over."
  hostname           = "primary-website.mycompany.com"
  check_frequency    = 300
  expected_addresses = ["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]
  trigger_count      = 3
  check_host_id      = data.endpointmonitor_check_host.controller.id
  check_group_id     = data.endpointmonitor_check_group.dns.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `check_group_id` (Number) The id of the Check Group the check belongs to. This also determines check frequency.
- `expected_addresses` (List of String) The list of addresses expected to be returned for the given hostname. Addresses returned outside of this list will result in the check reporting a failure.
- `hostname` (String) The hostname to check.
- `name` (String) A name to describe in the check, used throughout EndPoint Monitor to describe this check, including in notifications.
- `trigger_count` (Number) The sequential number of failures that need to occur for a check to trigger an alert or notification.

### Optional

- `check_frequency` (Number) The frequency the check will be run in seconds.
- `check_host_group_id` (Number) The id of a Check Host Group to run the check on.
- `check_host_id` (Number) The id of the Check Host to run the check on.
- `description` (String) A space to provide a longer description of the check if needed. Will default to the name if not set.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Allows the enabling/disabling of the check from executing.
- `maintenance_override` (Boolean) If set true then notifications and alerts will be suppressed for the check.
- `result_retention` (Number) The number of days to store historic results of the check.

### Read-Only
