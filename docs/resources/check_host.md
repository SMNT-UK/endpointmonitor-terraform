## Schema

### Required

- `description` (String) A place to provide more detail about the host if required.
- `enabled` (Boolean) If disabled checks set to run against this host will be paused.
- `hostname` (String) The hostname of the host. Must match what the host believes its own hostname is.
- `type` (String) Must be either CONTROLLER or AGENT. CONTROLLER is used for hosts that expose the Web GUI and required database access. AGENT is used for hosts that purely just run checks.

### Optional

- `max_checks` (Number) The maximum number of concurrent Web Journey checks the host can run. Default is 1.
- `send_check_files` (Boolean) For agents only. Indicates if it is to send check files such as screenshots back to the controller through the controller API. Should be enabled if there isn't a common file share between agent and controllers.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
