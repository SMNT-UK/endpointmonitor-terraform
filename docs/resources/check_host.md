## Schema

### Required

- `description` (String) A place to provide more detail about the host if required.
- `hostname` (String) The hostname of the host. Must match what the host believes its own hostname is.
- `type` (String) Must be either CONTROLLER, AGENT or ANDROID. CONTROLLER is used for hosts that expose the Web GUI and required database access. AGENT is used for hosts that purely just run checks. ANDROID is a specific type of agent that is capable of running Android Journey checks.

### Optional

- `enabled` (Boolean) If disabled checks set to run against this host will be paused.
- `max_checks` (Number) The maximum number of concurrent Web Journey checks the host can run. Default is 1.
- `send_check_files` (Boolean) For agents only. Indicates if it is to send check files such as screenshots back to the controller through the controller API. Should be enabled if there isn't a common file share between agent and controllers.

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Check Hosts can be imported using their numeric id, which can be see in the address bar when editing a Check host in the web interface.
terraform import endpointmonitor_check_host.example 123
```
